# claymore-monitor

## About

This is a very simple *Bash* script that can be used to monitor a running [Claymore](https://github.com/nanopool/Claymore-Dual-Miner/releases) miner. It makes use of [netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) and the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser. For email notifications, you might want to install *s-nail*.

Tested on an Arch Linux rig mining Ethereum (ETH).

## Useage

Run with either `show` or `watch` as sole argument.
